### Project Title
Interactive Bikeshare Data Exploration

### Description
In this project, as part of the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Course, I created an interactive user experience with python. Users can learn about **bikeshare data** from 
* Chicago, 
* New York City and 
* Washington 

This was a great exercise as a first project to use loops, interactive user input and functions. **Filtering** of which data was displayed to the user was **based on user input**.

### Files used
> chicago.csv
> new_york_city.csv
> washington.csv

### Credits
