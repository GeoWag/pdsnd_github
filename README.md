### Project Title
*Interactive Bikeshare Data Exploration*

### Description
In this project, as part of the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Course, I created an interactive user experience with python. Users can learn about **bikeshare data** from 
* Chicago, 
* New York City and 
* Washington 

This was a great exercise as a first project to use loops, interactive user input and functions. **Filtering** of which data was displayed to the user was **based on user input**.

Furthermore, it required some thorough thinking, as some data was only included in New York City and Chicago, but not in Washington. So, not all functions could be applied equally.

### Files used
- [x] chicago.csv
- [x] new_york_city.csv
- [x] washington.csv
